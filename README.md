# excercise
```
This is Ellie's Vue project, 

1. Excercise one link: http://localhost:8080/#/
note: the hero banner image, the background color is darker color, 
not do it. Also need to confirm the font size and style, diffent on mobile and desktop. 
Not much css, so not add sass/less, in the real project, use sass before.

2. Excercise two link: http://localhost:8080/#/second

3. Explain why the result of ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana.
as using + to join the string, in default it treat it as Number, so when + + 'a', it will print out NaN(not a number). so it is baNaNa, then lowercase to banana.
so ('b' + 'a' + + 'b' + 'a') -----it will be banana as well
